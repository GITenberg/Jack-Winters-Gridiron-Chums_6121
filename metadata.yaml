description: '"A shrill whistle sounded over the field where almost two dozen sturdily
  built boys in their middle ''teens, clad in an astonishing array of old and new
  football togs, had been struggling furiously. Instantly the commotion ceased as
  if by magic at this intimation from the coach, who also acted in practice as referee
  and umpire combined, that the ball was to be considered "dead."-excerpt.'
